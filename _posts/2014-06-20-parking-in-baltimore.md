title: Parking in Baltimore

Parking in most cities is a bitch. Searching for a parking spot is just part of living downtown and I've even started to accept tickets as just another tax. 

Since moving to Baltimore 2 years ago, we've paid just shy of $500 in parking tickets for parking in illegal spots and parking in the wrong spot of street sweeping (aka, money generation for Baltimore) days.
